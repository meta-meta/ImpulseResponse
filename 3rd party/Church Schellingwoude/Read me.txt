Dear users of the Small Schellingwoude Church IR, First i hope you will enjoy these impulse responses i've made. This IR was captured when i was at this place for a film shoot. It was not choosen because of the extraordinairy acoustics so highly suitable for chamber music, but maybe it is. We have to find out. The IR's are freeware, but i will be most honoured when you tell me you used them for your projects so please don't hestitate to let me know.  Fokke van SaaneThe Netherlandsfokkie@xs4all.nl
