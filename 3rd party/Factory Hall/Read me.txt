Dear users of the factory hall IR,I make Impulse responses because i like to experiment with the technique and i am in love with all kinds of reverb. The IR's i make are freeware, but i really love to hear that you use them so please don't hestitate to write me an email. All comments are welcome, both positive and negative. Fokke van SaaneThe Netherlandsfokkie@xs4all.nl
