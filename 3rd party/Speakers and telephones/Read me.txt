Dear users of the speakers and telephones IR's version 1.0 ,First i hope you will enjoy these impulse responses i've made. At least i have. Some IR's have a change in gain implemented wich can cause overloads to happen depending on the input signal. I made these gain changes to correct the overall level change between dry and effect. These IR's are intended to use as inserts. I would suggest that you insert a compressor before the Altiverb to prevent overloads. In former days when i used speakers like these to achieve an effect i also used a preceding compressor. I ommitted it now for your own personal taste of type and setting.This is my first set of IR's i distributed and i love to hear comments from users, both positive and negative. The IR's are freeware, but if you make a cd with it you owe me a copy.Fokke van SaaneThe Netherlandsfokkie@xs4all.nl
