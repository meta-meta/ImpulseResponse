## Binaural recordings of balloon pops and firecrackers paired with stereoscopic panoramas
* for use in a virtual acoustic diorama
* import the `.wav` files into your favorite convolution reverb VST (or other) plugin
* view the corresponding stereo pair of `.jpg` in a suitable XR stereo panorama viewer
* wear noise isolating headphones and live monitor with low-latency (~64 sample audio buffer), routing your microphone through the convolution reverb
* talk, shout, clap your hands, play your instrument as if you were in the space.
